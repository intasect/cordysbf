- Change: Fixed the export of the flows so that also a single / can be used as the root path for export.
- Change: CoBOC rules are now read from by organization instead of owner. This fixes a problem where all rules where not read from the server.
- Fix: An error is fixed when reading schedule template from the server.

- Unknown: BAM XMLStore content is now marked as Unpublished when packaged in an ISV package.

VERSION 1.6.31 (2008-12-23) 
- Add: Added property 'studio.bmp.export.check.lastmodified'. If this is set to "true", the BPM last modified date is read from the BPM XML inside the vcmdata file when BPM's are being copied from the server. The BPM is not exported if the server and local vcmdata file last modified timestamps are same.
- Fix: C3 inbox models now use the original object ID when packaged to an ISV package. This fixes problems when they are used from a BPM.
- Add: Proxy server authentication is now properly supported. Properties needed are: http.proxy.host = servername, http.proxy.port = 8080, http.proxy.user = proxyuser, http.proxy.password = proxypassword
- Change: When the web gateway server returns an error, the first 2048 characters of that message are displayed.
- Add: Web server and proxy authentication scheme can now be configured with property 'http.authentication.scheme'. NTLM authentication cannot be used for both web server and proxy authentication, so in this case property'http.authentication.scheme = basic' must be defined in the property files.

VERSION 1.6.30 (2008-11-10) 
- Fix: CoBOC inbox models were not correctly exported. This has now been fixed.
- Fix: If not set, CoBOC folder description is already filled with the name. This is more in line with the standard workings of CoBOC, but does not change the functionality.
- Change: When packaging BPM's with C3, the /Business Processes folder is no longer packaged in the ISV as it is created by the BPM deployer.

VERSION 1.6.29 (2008-10-28) 
- Update: All svnkit jars are now included. This fixes a problem with SubVERSION authentication.

VERSION 1.6.28 (2008-10-20) 
- Fix: CoBOC message template organization is now filled in the file when copied from Cordys server.
- Fix: fromcordys coboc sometimes lost empty namespace declarations. This has now been fixed.
- Fix: BAM method WSDL have XML definition, so it is now removed before writing the method to a file.
- Add: SubVERSION 1.5 libraries are now included in sdk/lib/svn-1.5. These can be used by defining :

set BF_SVN_VERSION=1.5
in the set-environment-vars.cmd or in the system environment variables.
- Fix: JUnit reports do not contain Java system properties anymore by default.

VERSION 1.6.27 (2008-08-29) 
- Fix: Fixed ISV loading problem when XReports ISV package was not installed. This is fixed by leaving empty ISV p content sections out. XReports ISV package still needs to be installed if XReports content is packaged in the ISV package.

VERSION 1.6.26 (2008-08-26) 
- Fix: XMLStore content was saved in the platform encoding instead of UTF-8 with fromcordys.

- Fix: cordys folder was not added to the ISV package if it contained project specific content.
- Fix: If a server had a C3 hotfix installed the BuildFramework could not determine the server VERSION.
- Add: Added C3 ISV package dependency support for the build scripts. Also the Dependencies.xml is added to src/content/isv folder for new projects (for old projects, it can be copied from sdk/build/new/isvfiles).

VERSION 1.6.23 (2008-03-07) 
- Change: Studio flow import now overwrites the BPM components.

VERSION 1.6.22 (2008-02-25) 
- Fix: WS-AppServer CoBOC template ISV packaging fixed for C3
- Change: Namespace URI's are now stored in the method set XML file in a separate element instead of an attribute, because Cordys method sets can have multiple namespaces. All methodset files will be changed when exported with fromcordys. Old methodset format is still supported.

VERSION 1.6.21 (2008-02-18) 
- Fix: Fixed runtime BPM (CoBOC) ISV packaging for C3.001
- Fix: Fixed Studio flow VERSION problem when packaging flows to an ISV package when the flows were exported from a Linux server.

- Change: _svn SubVERSION folders are also now filtered out. Previously only .svn folders were.
- Change: If a folder specified in the file src/isv/FileSystem.xml does not have any files (but maybe have empty subfolders), then that folder is not added to the ISV package, but a warning is displayed that the folder is ignored. ISV package does not allow adding of empty folders.

VERSION 1.6.18 (2008-01-03) 
- Change: Fixed C2 ISV packaging when BPMN objects were not added in the wizard. BPMN objects are not supported in an ISV package by C2, so it does not make sense to add them in the wizard page.

VERSION 1.6.17 (2007-12-18) 
- Change: The CoBOC BPMN and BPML (in C3) content are only exported if they are referenced by by the runtime BPM object. No other VERSION are exported. coboc.content property supports 'all' value which includes all supported content. coboc.content property can contain content type exclusions (e.g. -flows). This is usefull with the new 'all' value.
VERSION 1.6.16 (2007-12-14) 
- Fix: Fixed translation import with C3

VERSION 1.6.15 (2007-12-14) 
- Add: 1. Added properies below to sqldump task to generate seperate file for foreignkeys includeCreateTable includeIndex includeForeignKey 2. Added 'print' statements to generated database scripts
- Fix: C3 message templates and email models now use the original object ID from CoBOC instead of a generated one. This means that working with these message models with multiple BCP servers is not supported.

VERSION 1.6.13 (2007-11-28) 
- Fix: The fromcordys-methodsets failed to do the proper object mapping. This has been fixed.
- Fix: Email model ISV packaging in C3 is now fixed.

VERSION 1.6.11 (2007-11-09) 
- Change: When running build commands which access the SubVERSION repository (e.g. build release) , the entered passwords are now stored using the Java Preferences API (in Windows they are put into the Windows registry).

VERSION 1.6.10 (2007-11-09) 
- Update: Updated SvnKit to 1.1.4. This fixes authentication problems with the new Cordys Project Wizard in the Eclipse plugin.

VERSION 1.6.9 (2007-10-26) 
- Fix: If the FlowMerge could not create the file a NullPointer exception would occur instead of a proper message
- Fix: If role description contained & character, fromcordys would fail. This is now fixed.
- Fix: In C3 XForm translations were not exported correctly. This is now fixed.

VERSION 1.6.8 (2007-10-05) 
- Fix: Fixed all compiler warnings
- Fix: Fixed some problems in the update-project scripts.

VERSION 1.6.7 (2007-10-03) 
- Update: Changed some defaults in the user.properties when a new project is created debug=on is replaced with javac.debug=on This was an old bug.The user.classdir has been removed from the user.properties. It now defaults to ${cordys.home}/${project.deploy}/classes
- Add: Introduced 2 new environment variables that you can use via the set-environment-vars.cmd if you don't have the platform or sdk folder within the project's folder structure: BF_SDK_HOME: Absolute or relative path to the build framework folder (./sdk). BF_PLATFORM_HOME: Absolute or relative path to the Cordys platform folder (./platform)
- Change: Updated the build-*.xml files to import the handlers differently to allow absolute directory naming.
- Change: Updated the batchfiles to include the proper usage for the option to have the sdk and platform folder outside of the project folder.

VERSION 1.6.6 (2007-10-02) 
- Add: C3 Changes: CoBOC BPMN and BPML data import and export works. ISV packaging of runtime BPM works. They are also correctly deployed to the ISV level.
- Unknown: Added properties for setting levels of access control to different content types. Format is: content.allow.fromcordys = type[allow|deny|prompt] Multple types can be defined in one property e.g. content.allow.tocordys = all[prompt] xforms[deny] roles[allow]. In this case 'tocordys all' would prompt for an action, 'tocordys xforms' would give an error (not allowed) and 'tocordys roles' would always be executed without a prompt.
- Unknown: C3 message templates, inbox models and email models are now supported. Import of C2 inbox models does not yet work as the filesystem folder has been changed.
- Unknown: CoBOC process BPML and BPMN data is now written into the BPM file and not into separate files. This data is still read from /Business Processes/BPML and /Business Processes/BPMN but these folders are not used anymore on the file system. This helps keeping track of the latest published VERSION.

VERSION 1.6.5 (2007-09-18) 
- Add: Added support for Cordys BCP 4.2 C3 release. This VERSION has been tested against C3 build 235. Most of the functionality works but these items might cause problems: CoBOC BPML export/import does not yet work. CoBOC decision cases cannot be imported (they don't show in the Workbench). ISV packaging has not yet been tested.
- Add: Cordys BCP VERSION is read from the server. For ISV building the local platform jars are used. The VERSION can be overridden with property 'platform.VERSION.string', e.g. platform.VERSION.string = BCP4.2 C2 FP4 or platform.VERSION.string = BCP4.2 C3
- Add: Build number is now added to the ISV package isv.xml as it is supported by C3
- Add: Added a new project folder docs/external-dist. Files from this folder are not packaged in the ISV package, but are copied to the dist folder.

VERSION 1.6.4 (2007-08-15) 
- Fix: The tocordys-soapnodes can now handle a different LDAP root then mentioned in the XML file.
- Add: Added a stripped VERSION of the toruntime flows What you need is the following: - The desgintime VERSION - The runtime BPML (in src/content/coboc/folders/Business Processes) - The runtime BPMN (in src/content/coboc/folders/Business Processes/BPMN/Business Processes/FLOWNAME) Then you can execute a toruntime flows
- Add: The tocordys flows now will replace any organizational roles that have been assigned to an activity. This means that if the flow was developed in organization X, but deployed to organization Y previously Studio would give a warning and change it automatically. Now the buildframework takes care of this.
- Fix: All parameters read from property files are now trimmed. Previously extra spaces at the end of an parameter cause confusing errors.
- Fix: everyoneInOrganization role does not get itself as a super role when importing it with tocordys. Note that it is not possible to export this role with fromcordys.

VERSION 1.6.0 (2007-06-25) 
- Add: New build of the 1.6 series

VERSION 1.5.28 (2007-06-25)

- Update: Updates the projects site style to the new VERSION.

VERSION 1.5.25 (2007-05-22) 
- Update: Cleaned up the soapdispatcher interface (default properties are taked from the project properties if not explicitly set for the task).

VERSION 1.5.24 (2007-05-21)

- Fix: Fixes for single content export/import

VERSION 1.5.23 (2007-05-03) 
- Fix: MonitorTask (monitor in Ant) now properly uses the SoapRequestManager framework. Previously it worked only when connection mode was set to 'bus'.
- Add: Added target tocordys-devclasses. dev.classes.destination - Classes are copied to this folder. dev.classes.restart.action	 - Optional action to be performed after classes are copied.ssible values are: wsappserver-reload-classes - Calls the Ws-AppServer ReloadClasses in the current organization. Note that the classes must be copied to the CORDYS_HOME/bsf/runtime/deploy folder. restart-soapprocessor	 - Restarts the SOAP processor given with property 'dev.classes.restart.soapnode.dn' Note that this DN only includes the SOAP processor and SOAP node parts, e.g. cn=soap processor,cn=soap node. Leave this parameter empty, if no action is needed.

VERSION 1.5.22 (2007-04-24) 
- Change: tocordys, fromcordys and deletecordys commands do not work anymore without the content type. This was removed to avoid accidental copying of wrong content. To copy all content, use the 'all' content type.
- Fix: When an invalid XML file was imported to XMLStore (content types of Ws-AppServer, menus, toolbars and generic XMLStore content) the build didn't fail, but the content of the previous file was imported.
- Add: New property single.content.file can be used for selecting single content by file names. Files are separated by a semi-colon. This is mainly intended for the CEP plug-in.

VERSION 1.5.21 (2007-04-18) 
- Change: Methodsets are now imported and exported one at a time to reduce the used memory.
- Change: Methodsets are now sorted alphabetically inside the methodset file. This helps comparing the file for modifications in the case the methods came in a different order from the LDAP.

VERSION 1.5.20 (2007-04-17) 
- Add: Added following features for easier deployment: Support for importing and exporting organizational users. A new task 'create-cordys-organization' which create the organization specified in the project property 'content.userdn'. Note that this user must also exist in the 'system' organization and must have the system administrator role. Studio is initialized automatically before importing Studio content, if needed. Also user preferences are filled, if needed.
- Add: Added the properties to the default project.properties so that it's easy to generate a VERSION.java.

VERSION 1.5.19 (2007-04-11) 
- Fix: Internal build for CoBOC 2 code migration.

VERSION 1.5.18 (2007-04-05)

- Update: Project site settings are now moved to file ${env.BUILDFRAMEWORK_SETTINGS}/projectsites/[projectname].properties. The environment variable BUILDFRAMEWORK_SETTINGS must be set in the local machine in order to be able to generate project sites.

VERSION 1.5.15 (2007-03-21) 
- Fix: Fixed CoBOC content insertion when using connection mode 'bus'.
- Fix: Project update now changes ${src.content.xforms} to ${src.content.studio.xforms} in file. src/content/isv/XForms.xml.

VERSION 1.5.14 (2007-03-21) 
- Fix: The user.classdir property accidently was removed. It is now in the framework.properties pointing to ${cordys.home}\\${project.deploy}\\classes.
- Fix: Changed the question text in the tocordys batchfile.
- Fix: Fixed CoBOC content insertion when using connection mode 'bus'.
- Fix: Project update now changes ${src.content.xforms} to ${src.content.studio.xforms} in file. src/content/isv/XForms.xml.

VERSION 1.5.0 (2007-03-20) 
- Change: A release build number does not include the milestone number anymore as it is unnecessary in the release build. Also a release build resets the milestone number so that it behaves more logically.  For example: build milestone -> 1.0.10.2, build milestone -> 1.0.10.3
- Change: Project labeling in SVN has been changed. The build is labeled when the project has been built sucessfully. Now it should be easy to redo a failed build with the same build number without having to clean up the labels.
- Add: Added initial support for simple project site generation.
- Change: The svnAnt has been updated to support SVN 1.4. This includes an update from javasvn to svnkit. Also the custom ant tasks which were part of this project have been moved to the CoE svnAnt project. The new VERSION of svnAnt is 1.2.14, which is based on svnkit 1.1.1.

- Add: A new batchfile has been added to update the project to the current VERSION as well.
- Change: From this VERSION onwards the whole sdk folder should be externalized.
- Change: All logic for creating and updating a project have been moved to this project. The CEP project only takes care of the Eclipse specific functionality. All logic with regard to the project is within this project.
